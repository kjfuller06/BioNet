# Script is for checking suspicious data in a subset of BioNet flora survey data concerning cover and abundance estimates of Eucalypts species only. This subset has been coined "P-A" for Presence-Absence, meaning these surveys can be used to generate presence/absence data for species distribution modeling.

# there's a variable I haven't examined I might want to include in the final subset, which is NumberIndividuals

# I took a look at these dates to see why the starting and ending dates don't match. Many records(all?) with the start date 1970-01-01 list an end date in 2011. This was a random selection so there could be further, similar issues. This could also be an error resulting from date format conversion. Let's look at the original df

## not a problem for the original data. All records with a start date of 1970-01-01 have an end date of either 30/06/2011 (2378 records) or 31/01/2000 (9 records). So what is going on here? Are these return plots or is the date of the survey unknown?

# Ok, I really don't know what the smallest denomination is within the unique identifiers. I need one that identifies unique survey & subplotID (-replicate) and one that identifies a location full stop. Survey and location date are contained in "Ã¯..DatasetName", SightingKey, LocationKey, SurveyName, CensusKey, SiteNo, ReplicateNo and SubplotID
# let's take a look at each in turn, starting with counts.
sumflora = data.frame(types = c("total", "datasetname", "sightingkey", "locationkey", "surveyname", "censuskey", "siteno", "replicateno", "subplotid"), obs = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9))

# unique(sightingkey) is the same length as the whole dataset so that's useless.
# locationkey is almost = siteno. Let me check the coordinates. Also check the time indices for there being different time points (could be tied to SiteNo duplicates)
sites = flora %>%

  dplyr::select(LocationKey, SiteNo, Latitude_GDA94, Longitude_GDA94, DateFirst, DateLast)
## coordinates are all based more on LocationKey than SiteNo
## Date change accounts for at least one of the LocationKey duplicates, where the SiteNo changes with the date but the coordinates don't change.
### what I should probably do is just generate a unique key for coordinate + date combinations so it's obvious what I'm looking at.

# check that there are no other duplicates of lat/lon so that LocationKey is a unique ID of lat/lon coordinates. 
sumflora = data.frame(types = c("total", "datasetname", "sightingkey", "date1", "date2", "locationkey", "lat", "lon", "surveyname", "censuskey", "siteno", "replicateno", "subplotid"), obs = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13))

  sumflora[a, 2] = length(unique(flora[,i]))
  a = a+1
}
sumflora
## LocationKey is longer than lat/lon so presumably there are duplicate coordinates for some LocationKey's
## There are more LocationKey's than dates, which makes sense. Do I need to know how many repeated measures there are? Should I grop them by 10m buffer?
